Mirai Ran was inspired by the Mirai Ikusa (revision 323) mod, which was forked from the SenGoku mod which was forked from the KoRx mod (version 0.32), which was forked from Librelous (revision 1860) which was a fork of Tremulous.

Mirai Ran is being transferred in concept to a completely different game engine. Tesseract - which is a fork of Sauerbraten Cube2. Although skirmishes will continue to consist of assymetric opposing teams of greatly differing capabilities, this will go a step further in Mirai Ran.

Models used are placeholders only, won't be in final game.
